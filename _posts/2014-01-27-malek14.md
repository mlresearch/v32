title: Linear Programming for Large-Scale Markov Decision Problems
abstract: We consider the problem of controlling a Markov decision  process (MDP)
  with a large state space, so as to minimize average cost.  Since it is intractable
  to compete with the optimal policy for large  scale problems, we pursue the more
  modest goal of competing with a  low-dimensional family of policies. We use the
  dual linear programming  formulation of the MDP average cost problem, in which the
  variable is  a stationary distribution over state-action pairs, and we consider
  a  neighborhood of a low-dimensional subset of the set of stationary  distributions
  (defined in terms of state-action features) as  the comparison class.  We propose
  two techniques, one based on stochastic convex optimization,  and one based on constraint
  sampling. In both cases, we give bounds  that show that the performance of our algorithms
  approaches the best  achievable by any policy in the comparison class. Most importantly,  these
  results depend on the size of the comparison class, but not  on the size of the
  state space.  Preliminary experiments  show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms
  in a queuing  application.
