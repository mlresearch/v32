title: Fast Computation of Wasserstein Barycenters
abstract: We present new algorithms to compute the mean of a set of N empirical probability
  measures under the optimal transport metric. This mean, known as the Wasserstein
  barycenter \citepagueh2011barycenters,rabin2012, is the measure that minimizes the
  sum of its Wasserstein distances to each element in that set. We argue through a
  simple example that Wasserstein barycenters have appealing properties that differentiate
  them from other barycenters proposed recently, which all build on kernel smoothing
  and/or Bregman divergences. Two original algorithms are proposed that require the
  repeated computation of primal and dual optimal solutions of transport problems.
  However direct implementation of these algorithms is too costly as optimal transports
  are notoriously computationally expensive. Extending the work of \citetcuturi2013sinkhorn,
  we smooth both the primal and dual of the optimal transport problem to recover fast
  approximations of the primal and dual optimal solutions. We apply these algorithms
  to the visualization of perturbed images and to a clustering problem.
